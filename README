Usage
=====

Add a new function
------------------

All the merge functions are in core.py.

 - place the code in core.py
 - the name must end with '_merge'
 - and it needs a docstring like the others.

After that it will be auto loaded and everything will be taken care of on its own.

Profile a function/list combo
-----------------------------

$ python3 profiler.py -f alexis -l timing_1

This will open a snakeviz visualisation of the execution profile in your browser at the end.

Test all the functions
----------------------

$ python3 test.py

lists/test_list.txt is just random, I didn't give it much thought.

Time all the functions
----------------------

$ python3 timing.py

- Ctrl-C to skip a test.
- Two fast Ctrl-C to exit.
